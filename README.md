# 🎵 Savan Music Webpage Clone

Hello Everyone! 👋  
This is a **beginner-friendly music webpage project** inspired by **Savan (JioSaavn)**.  
I’ve created a **simple clone** that gives you a clear idea of how to design and structure a **music player interface** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

You can explore the code, understand the layout, and modify it according to your own creativity and needs!
